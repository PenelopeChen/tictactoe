# TicTacToe

This is the 1st front-end project I created at the General Assembly SEI60 course. TTT (TicTacToe) is a simple, turn-based game for 2 players. The 1st player to achieve a row, column or diagonal of 3 same symbols (x's or o's) on the board wins. TTT consists of 3 front-end languages: 
- HTML5 (to structure the sections, lines and text)
- CSS3 (to style the HTML5 with colours and the jazz)
- & vanilla JavaScript (which adds interactivity to the site).

- Feel free to play the TTT itself on https://penelopechen.github.io/tictactoe/ !


## Approach 

I am methodical when it comes to doing complex projects with multiple components. Planning a visual layout first is the easiest for me. This allows me to have a visual reference when creating the pseudocodes. My intial sketch which got transferred on Figma became my visual reference for creating the pseudocodes. With these components, I was able to efficiently code the HTML & CSS files and focus on the vanilla JavaScript file to make the game functional.
