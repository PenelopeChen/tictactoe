# TicTacToe

This is the first front-end project I will create at the General Assembly SEI60 course. TTT (TicTacToe) is a simple game for 2 players. The first player to achieve a row, column or diagonal of 3 symbols on the board wins. TTT will consist of 3 front-end languages: 
- HTML5 
- CSS3 
- & vanilla JavaScript. 

## Project Components

- Wireframe design on Figma

- Pseudocodes (HTML5, CSS3, JS) on Notion

- The TTT itself

## Approach 

I am methodical when it comes to doing complex projects with multiple components. Planning a visual layout first is the easiest for me. This allows me to have a visual reference when creating the pseudocodes. If there are any complex systems needed for the game, I will eventually add in a flow diagram.
