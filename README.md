# TicTacToe

This is the 1st front-end project I created at the General Assembly SEI60 course. TTT (TicTacToe) is a simple, turn-based game for 2 players. The 1st player to achieve a row, column or diagonal of 3 same symbols (x's or o's) on the board wins. TTT consists of 3 front-end languages: 
- HTML5 
- CSS3 
- & vanilla JavaScript.

- The TTT itself

## Approach 

I am methodical when it comes to doing complex projects with multiple components. Planning a visual layout first is the easiest for me. This allows me to have a visual reference when creating the pseudocodes. My intial sketch which got transferred on Figma become my visual reference for creating the pseudocodes. With these components, I was able to efficiently code the HTML & CSS files and focus on the vanilla JavaScript file to make the game functional.
